Walking past him I find that the passage splits into three different ways
I hear along one passage, the murmors of dozens
Along another I hear a vicious crack, as if someone were breaking steel blades like they were twigs
The final corridor is peaceful and quiet >
I presume the last corridor also has its problems
No such thing as clear skies in crisis after all
But it's highly unlikely than being caught by dozens of people, or by the person who seems to be rampantly destroying steel
So I slink down the third hallway >
My footsteps make loud stomps as the heavy soles of my boots impact the irregular stone floor, and echo outwards
I walk deeper and deeper into the cave system getting more and more excited as I move closer to Mary unmolested
A smile spreads across my face as I start running forward >
My boots now cause an absolute ruckus as I storm through the rough tunnel
My lungs burn, my gaunt legs twist, my bun falls apart
But I don't care because for the first time in 10 years I feel so close to seeing Mary >
I can almost taste the sound of her laughter.
Yet what I soon taste isn't that instead it's silk, as I trip
And fall face forward onto a strange woman >
My knees practically rattle out of my legs as I crash onto the floor 
I give out a choked cry of pain
Before I step backwards and whimper in pain as I look at what I crashed into >
I see a woman in an elegant white robe, with a face as pale as snow
Yet on that face I see nothing inside, her gauntness giving off the impression that she's hollow
There's not a hint of color anywhere on her, and her white garb makes it feel like she's gotten dressed up for a funeral >
The Idealogue
*She brushes herself off with a visceral look of disgust*
Below, you're filthy
Not even dressed properly >
Alex
*Still rattled from the fall I stare at her in confusion*
*Before slowly rising a bit higher*
Excuse me Ma'am but could I move past you, as you might have been able to tell I'm in a bit of a hurry >
The Idealogue 
Certainly not, you have to look of an intruder, and no one shall reach fDrEeSePdAoImR >
Alex
How do you know- >
The Idealogue
*cutting me off*
Because fDrEeSePdAoImR said that my word is his will
His will is truth, so I am correct >
Alex
Well wh- >
The Idealogue
*cutting me off*
Because fDrEeSePdAoImR said so
There is no need for any further reasoning >
The Idealogue
I do not know anything, I do not need to know anything
When the world is hollow, and you can find no meaning, entrust meaning to those above you
Peace is found through acceptance >
