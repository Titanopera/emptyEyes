At long last I arrive at the end of the winding tunnels
To what she called fDrEeSePdAoImR
It is more ordinary that what I had imagined >
It looks like a regular man the only real difference are his eyes >
Unlike normal eyes they are not a blank white or a shifting blue like the skyeyes 
He instead has some sort of circle on top of his empty eyes
I disregard this after all I don't care about his stuff I just want to see my wife again >
Despair/Freedom
Ahh you've come at last
I had expected you at some point but not in this manner
Most come walking to me freely and not trodding all over my minions >
Despair/Freedom
Oh well it doesn't matter anyway
Nothing matters after all >
Alex
Above I am exhausted with all of you yapping on about how nothing matters
Why don't you all grow up and realize life isn't about making yourself miserable >
Despair/Freedom
Why wouldn't we talk about it, it's true
This entire debacle today was of little to no importance
After all, you're nothign but a toy abondoned on a piece of trash like the rest of us >
Alex 
What >
Despair/Freedom
Do I have to spell it out for you?
You're a very advanced toy that's been left on the shelf for the last 10 years
*With a swift motion he grabs your head* >
And with it comes a torrent of information 
I learn about video games, and humans, and computer chips
I open my eyes for the first time, and see the truth, that I'm a forgotten piece of trash >
Despair/Freedom
*Dismisively he waves and says*
The next sermon is in 30 minutes in the atreum, come by then
Your "Wife" living quarters is three doors down on the left >
I blankly stumble through the halls until I find a little plackard that reads Mary
Inside I see her, with new wrinkles, but just as beautiful as the day she was taken >
I collapse to the floor and cry, She holds me in her arms.
She says its okay my beautiful darling wife, we all had to go through it.
I ask with tears in my clear eyes, was all of this pointless all this pain and suffering >
She holds my head up and I meet her eye to eye as she says
No, you have done so much, and helped so many 
Was it worthless to have spent time with the people you love? >
Alex 
No >
Mary
Then why would that change now >
Mary 
Only one thing has really changed
The world has a new huge asshole, and we have to do our best
To make sure he can do as little damage as possible.
