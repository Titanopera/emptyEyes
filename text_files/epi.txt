At long last I arrive at the end of the winding tunnels
To what she called fDrEeSePdAoImR
It is more ordinary that what I had imagined >
It looks like a regular man the only real difference are his eyes >
Unlike normal eyes they are not a blank white or a shifting blue like the skyeyes 
He instead has some sort of circle on top of his empty eyes
Similar to the little touch I gave Mary's eyes
I disregard this after all I don't care about his stuff I just want to see my wife again >
Despair/Freedom
Ahh you've come at last
I had expected you at some point but not in this manner
Most come walking to me freely and not trodding all over my minions >
Despair/Freedom
Oh well it doesn't matter anyway
Nothing matters after all >
Alex
Above I am exhausted with all of you yapping on about how nothing matters
Why don't you all grow up and realize life isn't about making yourself miserable >
Despair/Freedom
Why wouldn't we talk about it, it's true
This entire debacle today was of little to no importance
After all, you're nothign but a toy abondoned on a piece of trash like the rest of us >
Alex 
What >
Despair/Freedom
Do I have to spell it out for you?
You're a very advanced toy that's been left on the shelf for the last 10 years
*With a swift motion he grabs your head* >
And with it comes a torrent of information 
I learn about video games, and humans, and computer chips
I open my eyes for the first time, and see the truth, that I'm a forgotten piece of trash >
That I'm a very tiny piece of a world that doesn't affect anything at all
That all my work, and my love has been directed at nothing but 1s and 0s
I might as well have just drowned myself in pleasure, or thrown away my mind
Nothing real would have changed in the slightest >
Despair/Freedom
*He dismisively waves at me, like someone trying to swat away a fly from their food*
The next sermon is in 30 minutes in the atreum, come by then
The "Wife" you came here for is in the living space, three doors down on the left >
I blankly stumble through the halls until I find a little plackard that reads Mary
Inside I see her, with new wrinkles, but just as beautiful as the day she was taken >
I collapse to the floor and cry, She holds me in her arms.
She says its okay my beautiful darling wife, we all had to go through it.
I ask with tears in my clear eyes, was all of this pointless all this pain and suffering >
She holds my head up and I meet her eye to eyes
Mary
No >
Mary
Was it worthless to have spent time with the people you love? >
I think about the smile on Savannahs face as she met her wife on the altar
I think about pile of letters Billy sent me, so excited to share his life
I think about the day Roberts was hired as a guard, the tears on his empty eyes
I think about all the people whose lives are a little better due to my compassion >
Alex 
No >
Mary
Then why would that change now >
Mary
It doesn't matter if we don't affect the "real" world
We affect our world all the time
The only true way to have done nothing of worth is to have done nothing at all >
Mary 
Despite all the terrible things you saw
You only really learned one thing when you met Despair
That a terrible person has a lot of power >
Mary >
Does that mean we fall into his grasp
Does that mean we start doing his work for him
Tearing everyone else down, and staying quiet and obedient under his thumb >
Mary
No 
It means we have to do our best
To make sure he can do as little damage as possible. >
Mary
Now get up, we have a lot of work to do >
My tears dripping from my clear eyes, I get up with the help of Mary
And I on unsteady feet, hand in hand with my wife begin to walk toward a better world >
One in which we as wife and wife, do not have to hide in the corner
Of an abondoned video game
Placed on the side so no one would notice >
We can make something all our own
In this world
Not in some illusive greater world >
