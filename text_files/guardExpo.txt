Having chosen my one magic item, I prepare myself with more mundane goods
With a warm pair of socks, a full waterskin, and a sturdy claosk, I walk out into the night
A slight wind chills my wizened frame
With a shiver I tighten my woolen cloak and walk to the edge of town >
As I plod down the cobbled road, I eventually find myself at the guard station
Cutting through the darkness, a lantern reveals my position to the guard 
Looking at them I remember their name, Roberts, wasn't it
I remember when they came in for their first batch of nice equipment a couple years ago >
The Guard
Is that you Alex?
You've got to be more careful, you must be dreadfully cold out here
This is far too late to be walking about for anything reasonable ... >
The Guard
*A rustle of steel bounces around the night as they turn, and truly look at me*
*Looking over the large, prepared pack, the warm clothes, the sturdy cloak*
You aren't out here for anything reasonable are you >
Alex
No, No I'm not >
The Guard
*A shock of concerns shoots across their helmeted face before it is quickly concealed*
I know that it's been a while, too long really
But you've got to hold out hope that the Skyeyes will complete his quest
Us Empty Eyes we don't stand a chance standing up to the enlightened >
Alex
I've hoped for 10 years Roberts
Past a certain point, hope isn't hope anymore
It's delusion >
The Guard
Still Alex, you have to hold onto something
Mary wouldn't want you to to throw away your life like this
You aren't some solitary island of grief there are other people here that care about you >
Alex 
I know
Despite it all some of the happiest memories in my life have been made after she was taken >
Alex 
I remember when Billy started up a shop in the nearby city with my loan, and all the excited letters after
I remember being the one to tie the blindfold for Savannahs wedding 
I remember encouraging you to get up and serve the community >
Alex
But you're wrong I haven't lost my hope
I've found it
I will make sure Mary walks out a free woman if it's the last thing I do >
The Guard
You do know if it's the last thing you do, Mary won't feel any better?
*Clearly uneasy but seeing my determination they sigh*
Well as an Unawakened guard I'll give you some tips so that you can hopefully make it out alive >
The Guard
With your skill set you will have three skills Beg, Bluff, Blackmail
With every action that aligns with that skill it will grow by 3
But it will also lower the other skills by 1 >
The Guard
You are ultimately empty, while some tools like mirrors allow you to glimpse the Song of the Universe
You cannot exceed certain levels of ability, with 10 being your limit
So it's best to not specialize too much and instead use a wide variety of strategies, since specific people respond better to specific strategies >
The Guard
All Items the Unawakened can wield have one thing in common they're one time use items
While you can use the physical object all you want all magical effects can only be used once >
The Guard
Your only chance is to utilize the sacred Meeting of the Eyes
If you look into their eyes, for three blinks you can speak calmly
You can attempt to slay them, but they can do the same >
The Guard
While both of your eyes might be empty, magic pulses through their veins
So any attempt to attack without extra power will miserably fail
It might be better to try to intimidate, persuade or lie your way past them >
Alex
Thanks for the advice Roberts, I'll keep it in mind. >
After the meeting with Roberts I get back onto the path
Eventually I reach the cave opening
I stare at the stark grey stone that my love, Mary has been forced to live under for a decade
And with a steady stride I step inside. >
