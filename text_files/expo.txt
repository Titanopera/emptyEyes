10 years ago my wife Mary went missing
I panicked looking far and wide for my beloved wife
13 days later the ransom letter came >
The cultists asked for one million gold coins
An amount so absurd I laughed when I read the letter
I learned quickly however that this was no joke >
Unable to earn that absurd amount I begged for the help of the hero
To my joy they agreed, and the Song of the Universe rang
It's been 10 years >
They come into my shop every day
Offloading their junk onto me
But they ignored my pleas for their help >
Their shifting blue eyes filled with nothing but apathy 
Not even granting me the dignity of pity or disgust >
In the end I had to accept that they simply wouldn't help
I had to pay the random myself >
I tried so much
I begged, I bluffed, I blackmailed >
Yet >
After 10 years >
I don't have even half the amount >
I am no warrior
My weak and frail muscles have no magic pulsing through them
I can't hear the Song of the Universe >
Yet nonetheless I will rise
I can't bear to think of her suffering anymore
I just want to be with her again >
I want to see her tools scattered around my store
I want to hear her talk about her projects for hours
I want to feel safe in her arms >
But I am safe no longer.

I do not have to do this 
But I refuse to be without her any longer >
