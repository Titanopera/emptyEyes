I walk into the cave and I see someone laying in the entrance
A man, surrounded by strange bottles, barely covered in rags
As I look closer I realize that it's Jason
He went missing a couple of months ago, after he lost his hand in a mill and refused to keep begging >
Alex
Is that you Jason
You don't look quite right
You barely even look human >
The Hedonist
None of us are human
We might as well enjoy what we've got left
Leave me be >
Alex 
No, I have to get past, I have to save Mary >
The Hedonist
That doesn't matter none of this matters just run back to town and leave me alone >
