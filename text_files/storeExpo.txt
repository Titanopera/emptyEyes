I slowly walk down the stairs
Carefully holding the lovingly carved railing in my frail hands
The dim glow of the moon on this long night barely lighting my way >
I see the familiar sight of our storefront
Every sweep of my eyes causing that familiar pain
As I remember all the little things Mary made >
I hear the sound of her painted sign softly clinking against the window as the wind pushes it too and fro.
I feel the grooves of the counter that she carved
I see all the little hinges she took forevor to make
Above, those took her a while, we should have just bought some, but she wanted to make it, so she did >
I sigh, feeling that oh so familiar empty spot right behind my heart
Before I turn to the sight behind the counter
My only three magical goods >
I can't bear to carry more than one for long 
They pull too much into my frail eyes
So I'll have to be careful in what I bring >
